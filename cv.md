## Briefly About Myself

I was working as a frontend developer for 6 years. I started in a small local company that develops sites in different spheres. The last place of my job was in IT company NetCracker. I had to quit it because of my maternity leave and relocation. And now I want to go back and keep doing what I like despite a long break.

I believe that I am learning fast and that course will greatly help me.
